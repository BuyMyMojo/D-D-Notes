This peculiar critter is the smallest, yet most intelligent representative of the highly poisonous Wurm genus. With its remarkable ability to perfectly imitate a piece of paper, it secretly roams wherever books are present - from the dust-ridden library of an ancient civilisation to the buzzing book shop selling heavy tombs and fantastic scrolls. Being able to remain motionless over extended periods of time, its not uncommon for this whimsical creature to be used for a hasty note, a secret message or a cheesy poem of love - completely unnoticed by the unwary author. 

**Living Scripts.** Book Wurms can live up to several centuries. The oldest ones are often covered in countless hieroglyphs, potentially bearing the knowledge from long-forgotten times.
